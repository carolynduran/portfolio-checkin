      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <h3>Who can join?</h3>
        <p>Any and all female or male undergraduate and graduate students of the University of Michigan are eligible to participate. There are no tryouts. Contact an officer or come to practice if you'd like to join.</p>
      <h3>Do I have to pay to be on the team?</h3>
        <p>Yes.  Each gymnast must pay dues for both the fall and winter semesters.   Dues range between $100-$200 each semester.  This is a flat fee that must be paid to be a member of the team, regardless of how many times you end up coming to practice during the semester. Competitors must also pay for some travel fees in addition to paying dues. </p>
        <p>However, we have a grace period of 1-2 weeks at the beginning of each semester before we make dues mandatory. This a time during which you can come try out a few days of practice to see if you like practicing with the team!</p>
      <h3>Are there any other requirements?</h3>
        <p>Yes, there is one main task required of all team members.  All gymnasts are required to work a pre-determined number of Michigan varsity gymnastics meets, where we flash and run scores and work at the judges' tables.  The schedule of meets is given to us early in the season, which gives each member time to work out any conflicts so they are able to sign up for their choice of meets.  Team members who do not attend these meets are subject to penalty and fees.  Our help at the varsity meets assures our continued use of the varsity gymnastics facility, therefore this is a very important requirement that we take very seriously.</p>
      <h3>Where/when does the team practice?</h3>
        <p>While attendance at practice is not mandatory, it is in each member's best interest to attend practice often to get to know her/his fellow gymnasts.  For gymnasts that compete, we do require attendance the week prior to the competition.</p>
      <h3>2018-2019 practice schedule:</h3>
      <h4>Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday 6:30-8:30 p.m.</h4>
        <p>Practice is at the women's varsity gymnastics facility - The Donald R. Shepherd Training Center at 2300 S. State St., Ann Arbor, MI 48104, in the same complex as the varsity tennis facility.</p>
      <h4>Wednesday 7-9 p.m. and Sunday 1-3 p.m.</h4>
        <p>Practice is at the men's varsity gymnastics facility - The Newt Loken Gymnastics Training Center at the UM Sports Coliseum at 721 S Fifth Ave, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, where many intramural sports practice and compete. Gymnastics uses the west entrance to the building.</p>
      <h3>How can I get to the gym?</h3>
        <p>We try to set up carpools to and from practice at the beginning of the season. Many members walk to the men's varsity gymnastics facility at the Sports Coliseum for practice. On other days, to get to the women's varsity facility, an easy option is to take the white AATA Bus Route 62: UM-State, which makes a stop at many popular locations around campus and conveniently stops right in front of the gymnastics facility. Check out the AATA website at https://www.theride.org/ for more information and specific timing.</p>
      <h3>Do you practice during the spring or summer terms?</h3>
        <p>No, we only practice during the fall and winter terms. Our first day of practice for the Fall 2019 semester is Wednesday, September 4th, 2019 from 7:00-9:00pm at the Newt Loken Training Center. </p>
      <h3>Is there a coach?</h3>
        <p>Yes, we do have a coach.  We also have a paid supervisor in the gym at all times during practice.  Additionally, some girls do have coaching experience and we do ask one another for help on technique on occasion.  Please be careful when trying new or difficult skills, and be aware of your abilities and limitations. </p>
      <h3>How do you run practice?</h3>
        <p>Practice is run in an open-gym format. We do a group stretch at the beginning and then everyone goes off to work on their respective events. You can work on as many or as few events as you like, for as long as you like! </p>
      <h3>If I join the team, do I have to compete?</h3>
        <p>No, but competing is encouraged. We have some members who only come to practice to work out and some who choose to participate in competitions. However, all team members are welcome to compete, and competitions prove to be great team building experiences. Also, each gymnast selects which events she would like to compete at each meet. Competing in the all around is not required.</p>
      <h3>How do competitions work?</h3>
        <p>We are a registered member of the NAIGC, so we compete against other collegiate club gymnastics teams.  We drive to meets in the Midwest, and depending on the location, fly to Nationals.  NAIGC uses modified USAG Level 9 rules.  If you want to learn more about the NAIGC, visit their website at www.naigc.net. </p>
      <h3>Where have you competed previously?</h3>
        <p>In the past few years, the team has traveled to Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, Texas, Salt Lake City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, and California. Nationals 2020 will be held in Providence, Rhode Island. </p>
      <h3>Do you have fun?</h3>
        <p>We always have a good time! Our team has plenty of get-togethers outside of practice for everyone to bond and have fun. In the past, we have had game nights, gone bowling, and collected cans for fundraisers!</p>
